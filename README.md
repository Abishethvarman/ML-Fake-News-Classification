# ML-Fake-News-Detection

Project-based Course Overview
Welcome to "NLP : Fake News Detector". This is a project-based course which should take approximately 1.5 hours to finish. Before diving into the project, please take a look at the course objectives and structure:

Course Objectives
In this course, we are going to focus on the following learning objectives:

Apply python libraries to import and visualize datasets

Perform exploratory data analysis and plot word-cloud

Perform text data cleaning such as removing punctuation and stop words

Understand the concept of tokenizer.

Perform tokenizing and padding on text corpus to feed the deep learning model.

Understand the theory and intuition behind Recurrent Neural Networks and LSTM

Build and train the deep learning model

Access the performance of the trained model

      

Course Structure
This course is divided into 3 parts:

Project Overview: This introductory reading material will walk you through the project.

Fake News Detector: This is the hands on project that we will work on in Rhyme.

Graded Quiz: This is the final assignment that you need to pass in order to finish the course successfully.

Project Structure
